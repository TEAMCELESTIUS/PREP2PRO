# Video Editor with Local Version Control

A lightweight, single-user video editing software with built-in version control for managing edits locally. Save, track, and revert changes just like Git, but for video projects!

## Features

### Basic Video Editing
- Cut, trim, and merge video clips.
- Add text, effects, and transitions.
- Timeline-based editing interface.

### Local Version Control
- **Commit**: Save snapshots of your project at different stages.
- **Branch**: Create branches to experiment with different edits.
- **Merge**: Combine changes from different branches.
- **Diff**: Visualize changes between versions.
- **Revert**: Roll back to any previous version.

### Lightweight and Offline
- All data is stored locally on your device.
- No cloud storage or internet connection required.

### User-Friendly Interface
- Intuitive UI designed for single-user workflows.

## How Version Control Works

### Commits
- Each commit saves the current state of the timeline, applied effects, and other project metadata.
- Only differences (deltas) are stored to save space.

### Branches
- Experiment with edits without affecting the main timeline.
- Example: Create a `feature-intro` branch for a new intro animation.

### Merging
- Merge branches to combine changes.
- Conflicts (e.g., overlapping edits) are resolved manually.

### Diffs
- Visualize changes between versions (e.g., added/deleted clips, timeline adjustments).

## Supported Video Formats
- **Input**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and more.
- **Output**: MP4 (default), customizable in settings.

## Limitations
- **Storage**: Ensure your device has enough storage for large video files.
- **Performance**: Editing large videos may require a powerful machine.
- **Single-User**: Designed for personal use only; no collaboration features.
